The access conditions are somewhat specialized; the following are examples:
• The attacking party is limited to a group of systems or users at some level of
authorization, possibly untrusted.
• Some information must be gathered before a successful attack can be launched.
• The affected configuration is non-default, and is not commonly configured (e.g., a
vulnerability present when a server performs user account authentication via a
specific scheme, but not present for another authentication scheme).
• The attack requires a small amount of social engineering that might occasionally fool
cautious users (e.g., phishing attacks that modify a web browser’s status bar to show
a false link, having to be on someone’s "buddy" list before sending an IM exploit).
